A small project made for the company I was working for, to automate some volunteering challenges we had planned. Made using Strava Auth for authentification, Next JS to get better at it and Firebase as the backend.

Uses the Strava Auth to identify users. The users can upload their Strava activities to Firebase, which I then use to make rankings based on some conditions.
